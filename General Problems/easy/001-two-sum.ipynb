    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return *indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`*.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may assume that each input would have *exactly one solution*, and you may not use the *same element twice*.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can return the answer in any order.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1:\n",
    "- **Input:** `nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9`\n",
    "- **Output:** `[0,1]`\n",
    "- **Explanation:** Because `nums[0] + nums[1] == 9`, we return `[0, 1]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2:\n",
    "- **Input:** `nums = [3,2,4], target = 6`\n",
    "- **Output:** `[1,2]`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 3:\n",
    "- **Input:** `nums = [3,3], target = 6`\n",
    "- **Output:** `[0,1]`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "- `2 <= nums.length <= 10^4`\n",
    "- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`\n",
    "- `-10^9 <= target <= 10^9`\n",
    "- Only one valid answer exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Follow-up\n",

    "Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than `O(n^2)` time complexity?\n"

    "## Solution Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "I solved this using a hash map (dictionary) approach, which gives us O(n) time complexity instead of the naive O(n²) brute force solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Insight\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea is to use a dictionary to store numbers we've already seen along with their indices. For each number in the array, we calculate what we need (the complement: `target - num`). If we've already seen that complement, we've found our pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize an empty dictionary to track seen numbers and their indices\n",
    "2. Iterate through the array once using `enumerate` to get both index and value\n",
    "3. For each number, calculate the complement needed: `complement = target - num`\n",
    "4. Check if the complement exists in our dictionary\n",
    "5. If found, return the indices `[seen[complement], current_index]`\n",
    "6. If not found, add the current number to the dictionary for future lookups\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Works\n",
    "\n",
    "The critical part is checking for the complement *before* adding the current number to the dictionary. This ensures we don't accidentally use the same element twice. When we find a complement in the dictionary, it means we saw that number in a previous iteration, so we have two distinct indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "For `nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]` and `target = 9`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **i=0, num=2**: complement = 9 - 2 = 7. 7 not in seen → add `{2: 0}`\n",
    "- **i=1, num=7**: complement = 9 - 7 = 2. 2 is in seen at index 0 → return `[0, 1]` ✓\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complexity Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity:** O(n) - single pass through the array\n",
    "- **Space Complexity:** O(n) - in the worst case, we store almost all elements in the dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "This answers the follow-up question: yes, we can achieve better than O(n²) time complexity using this hash map approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Edge Cases Handled\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Repeated numbers:** Works correctly because we check before adding\n",
    "- **Negative numbers:** No issues, the complement calculation handles negatives naturally\n",
    "- **Large numbers:** Python's dictionary handles the constraints without problems\n",
    "\n",
    "### Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "Hash maps are incredibly powerful for reducing time complexity. The key pattern here is using a data structure to \"remember\" what we've seen, allowing us to make O(1) lookups instead of O(n) searches. This is a common technique in array problems where we need to find pairs or relationships between elements.\n"
