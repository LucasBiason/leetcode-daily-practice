        "## Solution Summary\n",
        "\n",
        "This problem requires filtering a DataFrame to find products that satisfy two conditions simultaneously: being low fat AND recyclable. The solution uses Pandas boolean indexing with the AND operator.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Approach\n",
        "\n",
        "The key insight is to use boolean indexing with the `&` operator (not Python's `and` keyword) to combine two boolean conditions. Each condition creates a boolean Series, and the `&` operator performs element-wise AND operation.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Implementation Details\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Create a boolean mask for `low_fats == 'Y'`\n",
        "2. Create a boolean mask for `recyclable == 'Y'`\n",
        "3. Combine both masks using `&` operator with parentheses (crucial for operator precedence)\n",
        "4. Filter the DataFrame using the combined mask\n",
        "5. Select only the `product_id` column\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why This Works\n",
        "\n",
        "Pandas boolean indexing is vectorized and efficient. The `&` operator performs element-wise AND on boolean Series, which is exactly what we need. Parentheses are essential because `&` has lower precedence than comparison operators.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Complexity Analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Time Complexity:** O(n) - single pass through the DataFrame to create boolean masks\n",
        "- **Space Complexity:** O(n) - boolean masks require space proportional to DataFrame size\n",
        "\n",
        "### Edge Cases Handled\n",
        "\n",
        "- Empty DataFrame: Returns empty DataFrame with correct column structure\n",
        "- No matching products: Returns empty DataFrame\n",
        "- All products match: Returns all product_ids\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Takeaways\n",
        "\n",
        "Pandas boolean indexing with `&` for AND operations is the idiomatic way to filter DataFrames with multiple conditions. Understanding operator precedence and using `&` instead of Python's `and` keyword is crucial for correct filtering operations.\n",
